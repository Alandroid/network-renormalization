## Introduction

The code and files here contained are part of an undergraduate research project in the Complex Systems Group of the University of Campinas - Brazil, supported by a CNPQ-PIBIC scholarship [[1]](#1). There is an ongoing update.


## Folders structure:

The `clustering_benchmark.py` python script applies three famous clustering algorithms to some real networks, obtained from the website in the references [[2]](#2):

In the 'presentations' folder, I included miscellaneous presentations and pdfs produced by me during the course of the research project.
