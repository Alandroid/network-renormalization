# Network renormalization algorithms

## Introduction

The code and files here contained are part of an undergraduate research project in the Complex Systems Group of the University of Campinas - Brazil, supported by a CNPQ-PIBIC scholarship [[1]](#1). There is an ongoing update.


## Folders structure:

The `main.py` python script runs the Mercator algorithm [[2]](#2) for the networks [[3]](#3) stored in the `data` folder in order to embed the nodes into the Hyperbolic space. After that, it renormalizes the network according to the procedure described in [[4]](#4):

In the 'presentations' folder, I included miscellaneous presentations and pdfs produced by me during the course of the research project.


## Running instructions:

To run the main file of this repository, please clone it and run the following command on a terminal:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
